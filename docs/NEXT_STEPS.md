# Next Steps

Forward-looking work for the O-RAN lab stack. Keep this file for planned changes, not session incident reports.

---

## Dynamic gNB lifecycle — stop hardcoding `e2_node_id`

### Context

Today the stack assumes **one static gNB**. Ansible `xapp.e2_node_id` (and `verify_stack` E2 gates) expect a single inventory name, typically `gnb_001_001_00019b`, derived from PLMN `001/01` plus srsRAN’s default `gnb_id=411` (`0x19b`). The xApp is started with that ID baked in via Helm; sample xApp code still has a TODO to discover E2 nodes from SubMgr instead of taking a fixed CLI flag.

That works for the single-gNB lab. It does **not** work if gNBs are spawned and removed dynamically.

### Practical recommendation

1. **Keep `e2_node_id` as a single-lab default** for the one-gNB testbed. Do not treat `vars.yml` as a live inventory.

2. **For dynamic gNBs, move the contract to:**
   - **Orchestrator assigns `gnb_id`** (and unique networking) → predicts `ranName` as `{type}_{mcc}_{mnc}_{hex(gnb_id)}[_{instance}]`.
   - **xApp / controller lists e2mgr and reconciles subscriptions** — treat `GET /v1/nodeb/states` (and E2T `ranNames`) as source of truth:
     - on add: subscribe when a node becomes `CONNECTED`
     - on remove: unsubscribe / drop the ID when it disconnects or disappears

3. **Do not grow a static list only in `ansible/inventories/group_vars/all/vars.yml`.** That file is deploy-time config, not a runtime registry.

### Also required beyond the ID string

- Unique `gnb_id` per live gNB (never reuse default `411` for two concurrent nodes).
- Unique Multus/OVS IP and NAD allocation (today CU/DU E2 IPs are fixed).
- RIC lifecycle: E2 Setup creates RNIB entries; teardown must leave clean disconnect state so xApps do not target ghosts.
- Verification: replace “wait for this one ID” with “expected set CONNECTED” or “at least N nodes”.

## Near-RT RIC RMR / indication path — durable baseline

### Context

KPM subscribe can succeed (`Successfully subscribed`, SubMgr REST OK) while the xApp
never sees `RIC Indication Received`. The NMI failure was traced to the AppMgr
inventory: the xApp registered with `txMessages: null` and `rxMessages: null`.
RTMgr 0.9.7 accepts the partial subscription route, but its full policy generator
skips subscription routes for an xApp with both message lists empty.

The xApp now registers the official subscription message contract, including
`RIC_INDICATION`. The deployment verifies that RTMgr's generated full policy
contains the exact `mse|12050|<subscription-id>|<xapp-service>` route. The old
periodic subscription-handle re-POST workaround has been removed.

The small `xAppBase` pending-ID race fix is separate defensive coding. It does
**not** replace fixing delivery of RMR msg type `12050` (RIC Indication).

### What must stay correct in config (product fix)

Land these in Helm / `ric/config` so a cold deploy works without Ansible
band-aids:

1. **SubMgr → RTMgr NBI port `3800`**
   - `ric-plt-rtmgr:0.9.7` ignores `local.host` and binds REST on **3800**, not
     `8989`.
   - Files: `helm/near-rt-ric/templates/configmaps.yaml`,
     `ric/config/submgr/submgr-config.yaml`.

2. **Keep the A1 route-management endpoint healthy**
   - M-release RTMgr expects `A1MEDIATOR` in PlatformComponents and opens its
     route-management wormhole on port `4561`; A1 data traffic uses `4562`.
   - The Helm chart now enables A1, exposes both ports, and waits for its HTTP
     healthcheck before starting RTMgr. If A1 is disabled for a reduced lab,
     remove its platform routes at the same time instead of leaving a dead
     endpoint that triggers repeated `newrt` redistribution.
   - Files: rtmgr configmap and A1 Deployment/Service in the Near-RT RIC chart.

3. **Explicit `RIC_SUB_*` / `RIC_SUB_DEL_*` platform routes**
   - SUBMAN must own subscribe/delete request toward the meid and receive
     RESP/FAILURE. Incomplete platform routes break or strand subscriptions.

4. **Stable RMR identities**
   - RTMgr `RMR_SRC_ID` must be a resolvable FQDN (e.g. `ric-rtmgr.<ns>`), not
     a bare name that fails route ACKs.
   - xApp `XAPP_IP` must be the **RMR Service FQDN** registered with AppMgr
     (`service-ricxapp-<release>-rmr.<ns>`), never a pod IP — otherwise RTMgr
     route create returns HTTP 400.

5. **RAN E2 attachment side + metrics that exist**
   - Lab path uses CU-UP E2 (`enable_cu_up_e2: true`, CU-CP E2 off) where that
     matches the connected node id.
   - xApp values (`simple-mon.yaml`) must request KPM style/metrics the gNB
     actually reports.

### Hard rule

**Do not restart E2Term after the xApp has subscribed.** That drops SCTP; srsRAN
CU often will not re-setup E2, leaving the gNB `DISCONNECTED` and orphaning the
just-installed `12050` route.

### Remaining Ansible lifecycle glue

`deploy_xapp` still compensates for one RTMgr 0.9.7 lifecycle limitation:

- Wait for a complete AppMgr registration → restart RTMgr → wait for route push
  → restart the xApp so it subscribes against a stable table.

**Next step:** replace the RTMgr restart with a reliable hot-reload path. RTMgr
0.9.7 does not refresh message lists on an existing endpoint UUID, so an AppMgr
callback alone cannot correct an incomplete earlier registration.

### How to tell network vs xApp

| Observation | Fix where |
|-------------|-----------|
| Subscribed + ID mapping logged, but never `RIC Indication Received` | RIC/deploy (routes, A1 wipe, AppMgr/XAPP_IP, E2Term) |
| RMR delivers `12050` but callback never runs | xApp map race (`_pending_event_instance_ids`) |

### Acceptance

Cold deploy (no manual kubectl): gNB `CONNECTED` → xApp registers → SubMgr
subscribe OK → RTMgr shows `12050` routes to xApp and e2term → xApp logs
periodic `RIC Indication Received` for several report periods with no
subscription-handle re-POST and no E2Term restart.

## Second xApp on a live RIC — unique release + RTMgr learn plan

### Context

Today Ansible only deploys one xApp release (`helm_releases.xapp` →
`r4-simple-mon`) into `ricxapp`. A **different** xApp (this repo or a separate
Ansible project) can join the **same** already-running Near-RT RIC, but it
shares AppMgr / RTMgr / SubMgr / E2Term with `simple-mon`. There is no isolated
RMR plane.

A plain “Helm install + wait for pod Ready” is not enough: the new xApp often
registers and even gets `Successfully subscribed` while never seeing
`RIC Indication Received`, for the same RTMgr lifecycle gaps documented above.

### Requirements for the second xApp

1. **Unique Helm release name** (and therefore unique K8s Service / RMR
   identity). Do **not** reuse `r4-simple-mon` — that upgrades/overwrites the
   existing release.
   - RMR Service FQDN pattern:
     `service-ricxapp-<release>-rmr.<namespace>` (e.g. namespace `ricxapp`).
2. **`XAPP_IP` must be that Service FQDN**, never a pod IP (RTMgr route create
   returns HTTP 400 otherwise).
3. Correct SubMgr / AppMgr URIs on the shared RIC
   (`ric-submgr` `:8088`, `ric-appmgr` register).
4. E2 node id + KPM style/metrics the connected gNB actually advertises (lab
   path is typically CU-UP). Same-node dual subscriptions may succeed or
   conflict depending on SubMgr/RAN — treat that as an explicit test, not an
   assumption.
5. **Do not restart E2Term** as part of bringing the second xApp up.

### Plan: RTMgr learning the new xApp

RTMgr only syncs xApps from AppMgr at **startup**. After the new xApp registers
with AppMgr, RTMgr will not reliably push platform routes to the new endpoint
until it reloads AppMgr’s inventory.

**Required sequence (deploy playbook for the second xApp):**

1. Install the new release (unique name) and wait until AppMgr register succeeds
   (`appmgr register` + `HTTP 201` in xApp logs).
2. **Resync RTMgr** so it learns the new xApp from AppMgr:
   - **Lab workaround (current):** `kubectl rollout restart deployment/ric-rtmgr`
     in the RIC namespace, wait for rollout, then wait for RTMgr logs showing
     successful `Update Routes to Endpoint` for the **new** Service FQDN
     (`…:4561` or whatever RMR port the chart uses).
   - **Product fix (prefer):** a real hot-reload / AppMgr→RTMgr notify path so
     a second xApp does **not** require restarting RTMgr on a live network.
3. Only after that route push: let the new xApp subscribe (restart the new xApp
   if it subscribed too early against an empty/stale table).
4. Confirm RTMgr installed subscription indication routes (`12050`) toward both
   the new xApp endpoint and `ric-e2term` (same class of checks as
   `deploy_xapp` for `Entries` / SubManager add success).
5. **Account for blast radius:** restarting RTMgr rebuilds RMR tables for the
   whole RIC. Existing `r4-simple-mon` indication routes (`mse|12050|<subid>`)
   can drop until SubMgr/handle path reinstalls them. Either:
   - re-run / share the existing subscription-handle re-POST heal for
     `simple-mon`, or
   - land the A1Mediator/`newrt` wipe fix above so residual wipes stop, and
   - verify both xApps still log `RIC Indication Received` after the resync.
6. Until A1/`newrt` is fixed, optionally re-POST
   `/ric/v1/handles/xapp-subscription-handle` for the **new** subscription id
   the same way `deploy_xapp` does for `simple-mon`.

### Out of scope for a naive second playbook

- Reusing this repo’s `deploy_xapp` as-is: it is hard-wired to
  `helm_releases.xapp` / `simple-mon` waits and will not gate the second
  release.
- Assuming the second Ansible can ignore RTMgr because “the network is already
  up” — platform routes for a **new** AppMgr registration are still the
  missing step.

### Acceptance

On a live stack that already has `r4-simple-mon` receiving KPM:

- Second xApp deploys under a **distinct** release/Service name.
- After the RTMgr learn step, RTMgr shows route updates for the new endpoint.
- New xApp logs `Successfully subscribed` and periodic
  `RIC Indication Received`.
- Existing `simple-mon` still receives indications (or recovers within the
  documented heal window) **without** an E2Term restart.

## Investigate `enable_cu_cp_e2` on newer srsRAN

### Context

The lab currently runs CU-UP E2 only (`enable_cu_up_e2: true`, `enable_cu_cp_e2: false`
in `helm/ran/templates/configmap-srsran-configs.yaml`). That choice came from srsRAN
**25.10**: the CU-CP KPM provider registered an E2 node but advertised **no usable
metrics**, so `simple-mon` subscriptions against CU-CP failed. CU-UP does expose
metrics the xApp requests (e.g. `DRB.PacketSuccessRateUlgNBUu`).

Newer srsRAN releases may have filled in CU-CP KPM (or RC) support. If they have,
re-enabling CU-CP E2 (alone or alongside CU-UP/DU) could unlock control-plane
metrics and simplify node-id expectations.

### Investigation

1. **Diff KPM providers** between the image/tag this stack builds
   (`dockerfiles/Dockerfile.srsran` / Chart `appVersion`) and current upstream
   `srsRAN_Project` release notes + source under CU-CP vs CU-UP E2/KPM.
2. **Catalog advertised metrics** for CU-CP when `enable_cu_cp_e2: true` (E2 Setup
   RAN function description / OID list in CU logs and e2mgr node inventory).
3. **Smoke test** on a throwaway deploy: flip to `enable_cu_cp_e2: true` (try with
   UP off first, then both on), note the e2mgr `ranName`, point
   `simple-mon.yaml` / `xapp.e2_node_id` at that ID, and subscribe to any metrics
   CU-CP actually lists.
4. **Decide policy** for the chart:
   - Keep CU-UP-only if CU-CP still has an empty KPM set.
   - Or document a version gate (e.g. “from release X, prefer CU-CP for …”) and
   update Helm defaults + Ansible `e2_node_id` accordingly.
5. **If both CP and UP E2 are viable**, document which node id xApps must use and
   whether dual agents cause duplicate/conflicting RNIB entries.

### Acceptance

Either (a) a short note here / in LEARNINGS that CU-CP KPM remains empty on the
pinned version (no chart change), or (b) Helm + xApp values updated to a proven
CU-CP metric set with cold-deploy indications working against the CU-CP node id.
